2025-01-11,5,"Positive experienceI spoke with Nurse Ms E. Waugh and I found her to be very knowledgeable, friendly and extremely helpful. I have been made to feel at ease with my weight loss journey and I feel very supported."
2025-01-10,5,"Exactly what I needed!The system in place is straightforward to use and information is easy to access and understand. The nurse practitioner I spoke with was friendly, extremely knowledgeable, and eager to answer the specific questions I had about my personal circumstances; she was very professional and not judgmental at all. I'll definitely continue using the service!"
2025-01-08,5,"Thorough Health Check before Weight Loss drugsPhone call on time, very thorough and explanations were given with each answer. Although I was not offered the weight loss drug I would of liked, I understand the doctor's reason. Thank you for being caring and honest and thorough with your questioning of my existing health issues."
2025-01-08,5,So simple and convenientI have been using Youly for almost one year now. I'm really happy with how easy it is to schedule a telehealth appointment and they always ring on time. Knowledgeable practitioners and simple sending of scripts which I then pay online and have sent by courier to my home. It's hassle free and reliable and I love that.
2025-01-05,5,"The results were worth itI have been using Youly for a year to help achieve my weight loss goal. Menopause kicked in and I put on quite a bit of weight which would not budge no matter how much I exercised/watched what I ate. After a phone consultation, my doctor and nurse practitioner come up with a plan to help. Weekly injections, monthly phone follow-ups and regular emails telling me what to expect helped me achieve my goal weight. I cannot speak highly enough of the team looking after me and the follow-up still happening. If you're considering trying Youly for your weight loss I recommend contacting them to discuss your options. I sat on the fence for six months before I made the commitment. The end result was worth the time and money."
2025-01-01,1,"Never available - don’t use for regular appointmentsI need to have monthly appointments but the team never have appointments available and when they do they move them, then I jump in a queue to get an appointment wait over 5 hours and I’m no longer able to take a personal medical call as I’m not waiting in my living room for 5 hours"
2024-12-17,5,BEST ONLINE HEALTHCARE EVERI decided to go through Youly for contraception methods for the first time and the doctor was very informative in my consultation and provided thorough explanations on which pill would be best suited to me and why. I have also ordered emergency contraception through Youly and it has always been such an easy process. I absolutely love Youly!
2024-12-13,1,"Scam. AvoidScam. Was told I would be eligible for a specific medication in their initial screening, paid a $49 consult fee, only to be told within 1 minute of my phone appointment that I wasn't eligible. Took my money, knew they couldn't help me."
2024-12-13,5,Great experienceVery quick and easy process and lovely Nurse Practitioner. Super happy
2024-12-13,5,"Stellar ServicesAfter 12 months of using Youly's services, I am thoroughly impressed. Their booking system, online support, and consultations with the nominated treating medical practitioner have all been stellar. I cannot fault their services in any way."
2024-12-12,5,"10/10Easy, quick and accessible way to get yourself a script."
2024-12-11,5,Wonderful experienceHad a consult with an extremely helpful and knowledgable doctor who listened to my needs and concerned and came up with a treatment plan suitable for me. Will be recommending to my friends to use as much more convenient than seeing a GP and felt much more specialised.
2024-11-27,5,So easy to useEasy online process and speaking with health professional who explained everything in detail
2024-11-26,5,"FaultlessJust fantastic. Natalie Smith was informative, answered all my questions, and was just delightful. Couldn't recommend enough."

2024-08-15,5,"Great staff assistanceFast and very friendly, supportive staff. They showed compassion and understanding"
2024-08-14,5,YOULY - keeping busy females healthy!All the clinicians at YOULY have been lovely and helpful. Life gets busy and YOULY allows for me to take care of my health while still living my busy life. Thank you YOULY!
2024-08-10,5,Helpful & worthwhile experiencesEvery appointment I have with a clinician at Youly has been with a helpful & knowledgeable clinician who cares about my health & progress made.
2024-08-06,5,"Friendly, judgement free zone!Friendly, no judgement service and very happy to help with any enquiries I have."
2024-08-03,1,"Very poor service, no refund $49 consultI recommended Youly to my friend who needed pain relief after having her breast cancer removed.
The queue told her it would be within the hour, the appointment time ended up being hours later 9-10 at night.
The doctor asked her for proof of cancer and breast surgery which she said she could provide. He then still said no to issuing the pain relief she requested and issued a script for a pain relief she is allergic to, which she had already said she was allergic to codeine. realised she’s allergic and ca...

2024-08-01,5,Excellent serviceConvenient service and lots of appointment availability. Seamless and hassle free! Highly recommend.
2024-07-28,5,"Great serviceGreat service, easy to understand and very approachable. Have recommended to others"
2024-07-26,5,Great helpThe whole process with Youly was so easy and simple. I will use them again!
2024-07-25,5,Good serviceVery good service and quick response from the team. A call with the clinician was very knowledgeable and helpful regarding my questions and found a solution
2024-07-23,5,"Fast, efficient and supportiveQuick question are followed by a prompt consultation with a GP who was able to give helpful information and address my concerns and questions for what I am hoping to achieve. Highly recommend. Great communication and clear idea of support to come to ensure I stay on track."
2024-07-19,5,"So far so goodI'm only just getting started but so far so good. Everyone has been so nice, warm and helpful. Product is very well priced, was posted fast and received overnight. I'm excited to continue my journey."
2024-07-18,5,"Wonderful Nurse Practitioner!The initial consultation took 48 hours of being in the queue, which wasn't ideal. However, when my wonderful Nurse Practitioner contacted me she was easy to talk to and talking me through my options. Then, Youly refunded my consultant fee due to my extended wait. So far, it's been great!"
2024-07-17,5,Efficient and caring serviceI’ve been so impressed with how professional and easy it has been to have a weight loss and menopause consult with Youly. The practitioners are knowledgeable and take the time to explain things very clearly. It was also extremely helpful to have an appointment on a Sunday. It is actually cheaper than going to my own doctor.
2024-07-16,5,"Fast and affordableVery happy, the way of the future with GPs no longer bulk billing for telehealth and most apps these days, was unable to get into my GP this week in person due to them being booked out & I am away this weekend so was trying to figure out a way to get what I need without taking time off & having to cancel plans
I believe my regular dr practice charges around $80 for a telehealth consult with a small portion back on medicare so was happy with $35.
For a recurrent infection I experience, needed a script for antibiotics, signed ... Read more"
2024-07-12,5,Beyond ConvenientI personally hate going to the doctors so the fact I can chat on the phone with a nurse so sign off on a new script every 12 months and just order as needed on the app has changed my life. The medication itself is only slightly more expensive than in store which I am more than happy to pay considering the convenience. I ordered my last prescription of medication on Tuesday night and it arrived Friday morning from QLD to regional VIC .. would definitely continue the service!
2023-08-31,5,"Easy to apply and quick response
Was able to order medication without a visit to my GP saving time and getting the prescription sooner (no wait time for appointment)"
2023-08-31,1,"Won't listen to your preferences
Would not prescribe the pill I prefer and when I expressed my preferences just ended the consultation."
2023-08-31,5,"This is perfect
Very easy to use and less time consuming. Can skip big waiting time"
2023-08-30,4,"Fast and effective
The app was easy to follow, which is important when you are unwell. The certificate was professional and what was required."
2023-08-30,2,"Delivery fee makes whole thing expensive
Great service up until you realise you have no choice but to purchase their medication and then pay the delivery fee of $18-19 but same day service is good. Be better if you had the option of a script to purchase yourself but I guess that’s how they ensure they make their money. If you’re willing to pay to save your time this is good but more expensive than the normal process."
2023-08-30,5,"Safe and easy
Quick, safe and easy to get my contraceptive pills, I’ve just started, let see how I go for my renovation"
2023-08-27,5,"So convenient
The whole process was fast and convenient. The doctor I spoke too was very friendly and I had my new script in less then half an hour on a Sunday"
2023-08-25,5,"An amazing service
Such an amazingly easy service and definitely well worth the ease especially when needing a med urgently. Would recommend 100%"
2023-08-24,5,"Great service very helpful and easy to use
Great service as I had to get medical certificate for work as I wasn't well and was very helpful and great to use. Would highly recommend."
2023-08-23,5,"Efficient service
I find it difficult to get in to see my doctor these days and being able to use this online service for a work certificate is such a relief"
2023-08-23,5,"Easy to use website, and Phenomenal customer service!
You can opt for the medication to be shipped to you or get an e-script, I also like the fact that Youly is very ""female friendly "" in terms of helping with women's problems. Easy to use website and the cost, well it makes up for the convenience of the mail order or e-scripts or medical certificates or various other things Youly offers."
2023-08-22,5,"Makes life easier
I was able to renew a prescription and get the pill deliverer to my door within 48 hours! Saved me a huge time burden arranging appointments with doctors, getting the script, getting the script filled. Also huge money saver! Would absolutely recommend to anyone who is busy and needs birth control in a hurry!"
2023-08-22,5,"fantastic!
easy,fast and door to door delivery which implies NO HASSLE at all."
2023-08-22,5,"Fantastic service and quick delivery
Customer service is fast and reliable, the GP calls are always pleasant and helpful. I highly recommend Youly and their service. I use them for prescription medication and they listen and understand your needs just like going to the GP but easier!"
2023-08-21,5,"Assist in weight loss
The practice nurse was amazing. Understood where I was coming from and where I wanted to get to. Thanks. Fingers crossed. Never used duromine but found alot of positives about it and outweigh the negative."
2023-07-15,5,I am amazed that this service existsThank goodness for Youly! Now I don’t need to go into a GP for contraceptives. So good. I ordered and it was delivered within a few days. Thank you!
2023-07-15,5,A Great Service!Youly is a game changer for me! I no longer need to waste time and money sitting in a doctor's office waiting just to get a new prescription. The assessment and ordering process is quick and easily done from the safety and comfort of home. Such a great service!
2023-07-15,4,Good serviceThe product arrived 3 days afterwards. Good product as recommended.
2023-07-13,5,"Youly is a game changer! Cannot recommend this enough!Cannot recommend Youly highly enough, so easy to use, great communication and super fast action and delivery. It is slightly more expensive than getting your prescription filled at a chemist but given that you don’t need to spend time waiting at a GP, waiting at the chemist and it gets delivered straight to your door it’s well worth it, would never get my contraception pill any other way after using Youly!
If you’re dubious about Youly or have any doubts give it a go you will not be disappointed!"
2023-07-12,5,"Easy and convenient at a good priceYouly is easy to use and reasonably priced, much cheaper than competitors who supply the same product. Delivery is express and reliable. Highly recommend."
2023-07-10,5,"The easiest way I’ve ever got the pillThis is the best healthcare service for women I’ve come across. I almost went to the doctors for $140 dollars just for a consultation, until I discovered Youly. I was able to get an online consultation for $25 (with a refund option if they couldn’t help), and then there were different pricing options for the pill. It was super easy, I didn’t have to spend a ridiculous amount of money, didn’t have to speak to anyone, and I’d definitely recommend."
2023-07-09,3,Pricey but convenientPricey but convenient. It arrives pretty quickly. Good if you forget to get your prescriptions renewed.
2023-07-07,3,"The repeat factor is great. But zero customer serviceI sent a message in March, I still haven’t had a response. Just some automatic message telling me someone will contact me soon. Considering my message was relating to side effects of the pill. That’s really terrible, especially because I have have followed up and only received an automatic response."
2023-07-04,5,"Great website and service!Looking for medical advice or prescriptions in an easy fashion, this is a wonderful platform. Timely responses to inquires, questions, and concerns. Clear instructions and details of what or why something has been suggested or prescribed. Friendly staff to top it off."
2023-07-01,5,Great at helpingI was having not the best side effects and they were more than happy to change the medication to one that works better for me
2023-06-27,5,Birth control pillsYouly is one of the best Productions that I have found I recommend to the women or men out there if you want medication or anything that you need this is the place to come to becomes delivered on time.

Was so easy to do and I didn’t have to leave my couch!"
2023-05-29,1,"SCAM RIP OFF
Take payment without providing a service. State will respond to communication within 24/48 hours which they do not do. State a Doctor will call you if need to discuss any concerns which doesn't happen. Ignore you when you try to communicate with them."
2023-05-29,5,"Fast and hassle free
Easy to use and had my product within days. Will definitely use this team for the future. Thank you"
2023-05-29,5,"The single most useful invention of the past decade
Thank you for existing Youly - you are literally the single most useful invention of the past decade. The fact that I don't even need to leave my house to visit a doctor or get a script filled is absolutely genius. Keep on making amazing things - you guys are the best!"
2023-05-28,5,"So convenient!

2023-05-22,5,"Amazing service love it
Such a great and needed service. Doctors are friendly and punctual. Very happy :)"
2023-05-17,3,"Convenient but beware of future auto orders
The disclosure of how this works and all the fees you pay upfront was not disclosed to me upfront. I also was not aware that the script I ordered initially will reoccur automatically after a short time. It did not give me any warning that it would automatically debit my account again and give me the option to cancel this if not needed."
2023-05-05,1,"Pathetic services - just took the money!
No one to talk to about the delay in the order
No updates provided and still chasing my order after 15 days!"
2023-05-02,5,"Very helpful
I love it, it 's very handy to manage scripts that need to be renewed regularly without having to go physically to see a doctor. Made my life easier!"

2023-03-12,5,"A great service for my busy life!I was unsure signing up for Youly as I've never used a service like this, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I'd highly recommend Youly to anyone looking for an easy quick way to get their pill. It's taken a huge weight of my mind knowing I don't have to fit in drs visits around my insane work schedule.

2023-03-08,3,"Convenient but expensiveI like the convenience of having it delivered (and delivery was very fast/efficient). Really good if you need a prescription but can’t wait weeks for a doc appointment.
But it’s expensive, the price for my contraceptive pill was over double the price advertised at local pharmacies. I don’t know why the price is inflated so much? Even when it says “free shipping”"
2023-03-04,5,"So easy, whoever thought of this is a geniusBrilliant idea, simple cheap and easy to get the prescription and the birth control send straight to my door so I don’t have to think about it - why should I have to pay to go to the doctor for a prescription I’ve been on for years?

2023-02-28,5,Don’t know why I didn’t do it soonerThe process is so easy and efficient. Instead of taking time off work and waiting 2 weeks to see my doctor for a script I have been getting for years I ordered from Youly. Delivery was extremely fast. Best thing I did was to try Youly. Show reply
