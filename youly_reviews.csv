The clinician that called me was clear and answered all of my questions and helped me shoos the right product for me. The prices are better than at the pharmacy and it has saved me alot of time and effort. Delivery was fast too! Great service, will definitely keep using this service."
2023-10-18T10:04:04.000Z,5,Medical certificateMy first experience with Youly & it was such a positive experience. I will definitely continue in the future with this service.
2023-10-18T06:18:27.000Z,2,It's a great idea but not run very wellI love the idea and the service has been helpful for me but the administration and management have aaaaaa loooooooot of improving to do. Can take 5+ days to hear back from anyone which is so frustrating when you have paid for a service and are waiting on medications.
2023-10-17T23:05:11.000Z,4,"AppointmentQuick easy system, doctors with actual knowledge and willing to explain. Script ordered and delivered in 3 days"
2023-10-17T04:18:18.000Z,1,"What a conThis website promises fast turnarounds,
then makes you pay for your appointment before telling you your wait time. Super sneaky, and there's no option to cancel your appointment for a refund."
2023-10-16T22:26:03.000Z,5,Quick & EasySuper easy and fast results. Took the hassle out of going to a doctor in person.
2023-10-15T00:42:53.000Z,2,"Abrupt and a bit of a wasteI wasn't informed that the medicine I was after has now been made over the counter - this would have saved me the consult fee. The call with the doctor was so short and meaningless - making it seem like it was just to tick a box - which, I know that's all it needed to be for the medication I needed, but the conversation was essentially ""hi, this is the doctor. You have hayfever? Anything else? Ok you've been approved"". It was a waste of the time I put aside for the call, and a waste of the money I had to pay for the consult."
2023-10-15T00:41:31.000Z,1,"Still waiting for my medicationI had a phone call consult Saturday, paid for my script. Received a message saying it had been dispatched still haven’t received it. The link states that it is refrigerated at the warehouse and has been pending this way for a few days - it’s now Thursday night still no delivery or update. Tried contacting support staff with no success. Very disappointing."
2023-10-14T09:13:09.000Z,5,"YoulyVery impressed with model. Well layed out and the doctor that called to review plan was very informative and caring. Early days, but so far ive been left with impression Youly deliver more than just a prescription."
2023-10-13T20:51:15.000Z,5,Youly has helped me on numerous occasionsYouly provides quick and easy access to a doctor when you need it. Also to be able to get a medical certificate online when you can’t get out of bed has made my life much simpler. I recommend Youly to anyone who prefers receiving their medication quickly by courier and for the reasons mentioned above. Great service. Thanks.
2023-10-13T09:45:29.000Z,1,Dangerous blood clotsWouldn’t recommend. They don’t offer any mitigation of blood clot risk. They don’t advertise or mention blood clots as a risk and then you end up in ICU with total occlusive bilateral saddle pe’s with a “safe pill” that doesn’t cause blood clots!
2023-10-12T12:51:53.000Z,5,ConvenientResponsive customer service. Lesser hassle than going to a doctor. Booked an appointment but i didnt get a call so i ended up joining the queue instead.
2023-10-10T02:27:01.000Z,1,"Horrible service! Avoid!I booked an appointment which costed $35. The doctor was literally on the phone with me for 28 seconds.
Then, I proceeded to order the meds. I ordered two boxes. They cancel one box and didn’t provide me with the correct refund. Worse still, the system is now showing that I have 0 repeats left. So I ended up paying $70 for one box of meds.
I should’ve just gone to a bulk billing GP, I would’ve been able to purchase 3 boxes for less than $70."
2023-10-05T02:00:19.000Z,5,"So easy, and much cheaper!Really happy with the service I received. Very friendly and professional, affordable and fast! Will be back."
2023-10-04T13:02:20.000Z,5,"great businessgreat for a quick med cert, cheap and easy. dr was very ncie"
2023-08-31T21:54:22.000Z,5,Easy to apply and quick responseWas able to order medication without a visit to my GP saving time and getting the prescription sooner (no wait time for appointment)
2023-08-31T04:19:12.000Z,1,Won't listen to your preferencesWould not prescribe the pill I prefer and when I expressed my preferences just ended the consultation.
2023-08-31T00:18:57.000Z,5,This is perfectVery easy to use and less time consuming. Can skip big waiting time
2023-08-30T22:19:12.000Z,4,"Fast and effectiveThe app was easy to follow, which is important when you are unwell. The certificate was professional and what was required."
2023-08-30T12:26:52.000Z,2,Delivery fee makes whole thing expensiveGreat service up until you realise you have no choice but to purchase their medication and then pay the delivery fee of $18-19 but same day service is good. Be better if you had the option of a script to purchase yourself but I guess that’s how they ensure they make their money. If you’re willing to pay to save your time this is good but more expensive than the normal process.
2023-08-30T10:03:15.000Z,5,"Safe and easyQuick, safe and easy to get my contraceptive pills, I’ve just started, let see how I go for my renovation"
2023-08-27T11:26:40.000Z,5,So convenientThe whole process was fast and convenient. The doctor I spoke too was very friendly and I had my new script in less then half an hour on a Sunday
2023-08-25T10:07:31.000Z,5,An amazing serviceSuch an amazingly easy service and definitely well worth the ease especially when needing a med urgently. Would recommend 100%
2023-08-24T09:55:56.000Z,5,Great service very helpful and easy to useGreat service as I had to get medical certificate for work as I wasn't well and was very helpful and great to use. Would highly recommend.
2023-08-23T11:09:46.000Z,5,Efficient serviceI find it difficult to get in to see my doctor these days and being able to use this online service for a work certificate is such a relief
2023-08-23T00:27:03.000Z,5,"Easy to use website, and Phenomenal customer service!You can opt for the medication to be shipped to you or get an e-script, I also like the fact that Youly is very ""female friendly "" in terms of helping with women's problems. Easy to use website and the cost, well it makes up for the convenience of the mail order or e-scripts or medical certificates or various other things Youly offers."
2023-08-22T23:59:44.000Z,5,"Makes life easierI was able to renew a prescription and get the pill deliverer to my door within 48 hours! Saved me a huge time burden arranging appointments with doctors, getting the script, getting the script filled. Also huge money saver! Would absolutely recommend to anyone who is busy and needs birth control in a hurry!"
2023-08-22T10:15:47.000Z,5,"fantastic!easy,fast and door to door delivery which implies NO HASSLE at all."
2023-08-22T04:31:48.000Z,5,"Fantastic service and quick deliveryCustomer service is fast and reliable, the GP calls are always pleasant and helpful. I highly recommend Youly and their service. I use them for prescription medication and they listen and understand your needs just like going to the GP but easier!"
2023-08-21T10:52:36.000Z,5,Assist in weight lossThe practice nurse was amazing. Understood where I was coming from and where I wanted to get to. Thanks. Fingers crossed. Never used duromine but found alot of positives about it and outweigh the negative.
2023-07-15T22:20:20.000Z,5,I am amazed that this service existsThank goodness for Youly! Now I don’t need to go into a GP for contraceptives. So good. I ordered and it was delivered within a few days. Thank you!
2023-07-15T11:35:24.000Z,5,A Great Service!Youly is a game changer for me! I no longer need to waste time and money sitting in a doctor's office waiting just to get a new prescription. The assessment and ordering process is quick and easily done from the safety and comfort of home. Such a great service!
2023-07-15T11:20:38.000Z,4,Good serviceThe product arrived 3 days afterwards. Good product as recommended.
2023-07-13T06:34:23.000Z,5,"Youly is a game changer! Cannot recommend this enough!Cannot recommend Youly highly enough, so easy to use, great communication and super fast action and delivery. It is slightly more expensive than getting your prescription filled at a chemist but given that you don’t need to spend time waiting at a GP, waiting at the chemist and it gets delivered straight to your door it’s well worth it, would never get my contraception pill any other way after using Youly!
If you’re dubious about Youly or have any doubts give it a go you will not be disappointed!"
2023-07-12T10:53:47.000Z,5,"Easy and convenient at a good priceYouly is easy to use and reasonably priced, much cheaper than competitors who supply the same product. Delivery is express and reliable. Highly recommend."
2023-07-10T11:59:40.000Z,5,"The easiest way I’ve ever got the pillThis is the best healthcare service for women I’ve come across. I almost went to the doctors for $140 dollars just for a consultation, until I discovered Youly. I was able to get an online consultation for $25 (with a refund option if they couldn’t help), and then there were different pricing options for the pill. It was super easy, I didn’t have to spend a ridiculous amount of money, didn’t have to speak to anyone, and I’d definitely recommend."
2023-07-09T01:11:53.000Z,3,Pricey but convenientPricey but convenient. It arrives pretty quickly. Good if you forget to get your prescriptions renewed.
2023-07-07T05:19:29.000Z,3,"The repeat factor is great. But zero customer serviceI sent a message in March, I still haven’t had a response. Just some automatic message telling me someone will contact me soon. Considering my message was relating to side effects of the pill. That’s really terrible, especially because I have have followed up and only received an automatic response."
2023-07-04T11:21:05.000Z,5,"Great website and service!Looking for medical advice or prescriptions in an easy fashion, this is a wonderful platform. Timely responses to inquires, questions, and concerns. Clear instructions and details of what or why something has been suggested or prescribed. Friendly staff to top it off."
2023-07-01T11:05:28.000Z,5,Great at helpingI was having not the best side effects and they were more than happy to change the medication to one that works better for me
2023-06-27T03:38:08.000Z,5,Birth control pillsYouly is one of the best Productions that I have found I recommend to the women or men out there if you want medication or anything that you need this is the place to come to becomes delivered on time.
2023-06-26T03:55:28.000Z,5,So convenient!!Very convenient when you can’t get into a doctor or don’t feel comfortable talking face to face. Bonus discreet packaging. Very professional and helpful

2023-05-30T10:06:49.000Z,5,Absoloutely perfectWas so easy to do and I didn’t have to leave my couch!
2023-05-29T23:15:24.000Z,1,SCAM RIP OFFTake payment without providing a service. State will respond to communication within 24/48 hours which they do not do. State a Doctor will call you if need to discuss any concerns which doesn't happen. Ignore you when you try to communicate with them.
2023-05-29T23:12:34.000Z,5,Fast and hassle freeEasy to use and had my product within days. Will definitely use this team for the future. Thank you
2023-05-29T01:09:01.000Z,5,The single most useful invention of the past decadeThank you for existing Youly - you are literally the single most useful invention of the past decade. The fact that I don't even need to leave my house to visit a doctor or get a script filled is absolutely genius. Keep on making amazing things - you guys are the best!
2023-05-28T07:37:31.000Z,5,So convenient!Love this service - save me so much time and hassle of going to the GP! Always get my pills before I run out of it. Highly recommend!

2023-05-22T10:21:22.000Z,5,Amazing service love itSuch a great and needed service. Doctors are friendly and punctual. Very happy :)
2023-05-17T22:25:01.000Z,3,Convenient but beware of future auto ordersThe disclosure of how this works and all the fees you pay upfront was not disclosed to me upfront. I also was not aware that the script I ordered initially will reoccur automatically after a short time. It did not give me any warning that it would automatically debit my account again and give me the option to cancel this if not needed.
2023-05-05T22:06:28.000Z,1,"Pathetic services - just took the money!No one to talk to about the delay in the order
No updates provided and still chasing my order after 15 days!"
2023-05-02T01:02:31.000Z,5,"Very helpfulI love it, it 's very handy to manage scripts that need to be renewed regularly without having to go physically to see a doctor. Made my life easier!"
2023-05-01T21:19:39.000Z,5,"This is great, I don't have to drag the kids along to an appt for my regular pillEasy to use, replies with 24-48 hours for queries. Not too expensive, everything is sent express."

2023-03-12T20:37:55.000Z,5,"A great service for my busy life!I was unsure signing up for Youly as I've never used a service like this, but I was pleasantly surprised. The sign up process was quick and easy, the cost was less than going to a doctor for just a script, and it meant I didn't have the month wait to see a GP, and the shipping was super fast. I'd highly recommend Youly to anyone looking for an easy quick way to get their pill. It's taken a huge weight of my mind knowing I don't have to fit in drs visits around my insane work schedule.

But it’s expensive, the price for my contraceptive pill was over double the price advertised at local pharmacies. I don’t know why the price is inflated so much? Even when it says “free shipping”"
